# Express Typescript Project

This project is based on the project generated by the `express-generator-typescript` starter.

It's intended to be a project replicating that starter but with each functionality added by hand all the way from npm init so that the purpose and function of every aspect of configuration is understood.

TODO:
    - Add unit tests functionality using the starter as reference.
    - Add DAO functionality using the starter as reference.

It includes integration with ejs, and material design lite. You can use it as a starting point for building database backed webapps.
